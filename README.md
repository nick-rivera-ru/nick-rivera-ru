Hi, 

I am Nick Rivera, an Analytics Engineer who specializes in empowering key stakeholders to leverage data for smarter, informed decision-making. I design and build data products that transform complex information into actionable insights. My work includes pricing models, customer analytics, KPI reports & dashboards, and automating labor-intensive processes. 

What sets me apart is not just my technical expertise but my ability to serve as a strategic partner. When I manage a project, I am not just executing tasks—I am asking critical questions and sharing insights to ensure we’re covering all angles. My ability to think outside the box and spark fresh perspectives comes from a decade of experience collaborating with C-Suite executives.

If you're not sure what your data can do for you, contact me via email at data.help.pls@gmail.com

## **Portfolio**

|Project Link |  Architecture | Description of Deliverable|
|------------ |  ------------ | -----------|
|[Process Automation](https://github.com/nick-rivera-ru/YouTube-Channel/blob/main/README.md) |  Knime, Command Line Scripting, Excel | This project addresses a common operational challenge: manual, time-consuming processes that drain team productivity. By developing a targeted automation solution, I transformed a repetitive customer service workflow into an efficient, streamlined system. The result enables customer service associates to redirect their time and energy toward more meaningful interactions and complex problem-solving, ultimately enhancing both operational efficiency and customer experience. |
|[Tableau Sales Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperstoreBreakEven/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  | Tableau, Excel | The Sales Dashboard offers stakeholders a comprehensive view of business performance. It includes three key sections: margin per product subcategory to spot winners and opportunities, margin dollar breakdown by category to track profitability, and weekly sales trends to monitor sales patterns and day-to-day performance.|
|[Annual Report](https://github.com/nick-rivera-ru/Annual-Report) |  Excel | This financial report provides a comprehensive year-over-year analysis of key metrics for an e-commerce retailer. It’s fully dynamic, updating automatically when users select a different year. The KPI boxes also feature drop-down menus, allowing users to customize the metrics displayed. This flexibility helps stakeholders focus on the metrics that matter most, offering valuable insights at their fingertips. |
|[Knime Tutoring](https://github.com/nick-rivera-ru/YouTube-Channel/blob/main/README.md) |  Knime, Excel | This is my YouTube channel, where I share tutorials for analytics professionals transitioning from Excel to KNIME. KNIME’s drag-and-drop data science tools let you build ETL processes at lightning speed, so you can spend less time coding and more time refining your data models. |
