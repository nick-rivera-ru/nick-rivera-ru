Hi, I’m Nick Rivera. 

I'm an Analytics Engineer that specializes in empowering key stakeholders to leverage data for smarter, informed decision-making. I design and build data products that transform complex information into actionable insights. My work includes pricing models, customer analytics, KPI reports & dashboards, and automating labor-intensive processes. 

What sets me apart is not just my technical expertise but my ability to serve as a strategic thought partner. When I take on a project, I’m not just executing tasks—I’m asking critical questions and sharing insights to ensure we’re covering all angles. My knack for thinking outside the box and sparking fresh perspectives comes from a decade of experience collaborating with C-Suite executives.

If you're looking to use data to drive your business, shoot me an email so we can discuss further how I can help you achieve that. My email is data.help.pls@gmail.com
