|[[Tableau Sales Dashboard]](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperstoreBreakEven/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  | Tableau, Excel | The Sales Dashboard offers stakeholders a comprehensive view of business performance. It includes three key sections: margin per product subcategory to spot winners and opportunities, margin dollar breakdown by category to track profitability, and weekly sales trends to monitor sales patterns and day-to-day performance.|
|[[Knime Tutoring]](https://www.youtube.com/@nickydee3088/videos) |  Knime, Excel | This is my YouTube channel, where I share tutorials for analytics professionals transitioning from Excel to KNIME. KNIME’s drag-and-drop data science tools let you build ETL processes at lightning speed, so you can spend less time coding and more time refining your data models. |

The report is dynamic as it updates when the user changes the year in view. The user can also use the drop downs in the KPI boxes to modify the KPI that's being reported on. |
