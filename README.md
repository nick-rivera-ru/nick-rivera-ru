|Project Link |  Architecture | Deliverable|
|------------ |  ------------ | -----------|
|[[Tableau Sales Dashboard]](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperstoreBreakEven/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  | Tableau, Excel | The Sales Dashboard offers stakeholders a comprehensive view of business performance. It includes three key sections: margin per product subcategory to spot winners and opportunities, margin dollar breakdown by category to track profitability, and weekly sales trends to monitor sales patterns and day-to-day performance.|
|[[Knime Tutoring]](https://www.youtube.com/@nickydee3088/videos) |  Knime, Excel | This is my YouTube channel, where I feature a multitude of tutorial videos for analytics folks that are looking to transition their work from Excel to Knime. The value that Knime brings to the table, aside from drag-and-drop data science, is that it allows users to build out ETL processes in lightining speed - you spend more time thinking about your data model than you do coding. |
