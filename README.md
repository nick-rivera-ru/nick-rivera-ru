|[[Tableau Sales Dashboard]](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperstoreBreakEven/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  | Tableau, Excel | This Sales Dashboard allows key stakeholders to the performance of the business over the last few weeks.|
|[[Knime Tutoring]](https://www.youtube.com/@nickydee3088/videos) |  Knime, Excel | This is my YouTube channel, where I feature a multitude of tutorial videos for analytics folks that are looking to transition their work from Excel to Knime. The value that Knime brings to the table, aside from drag-and-drop data science, is that it allows users to build out ETL processes in lightining speed. Take for example a SQL Query or a CLI script, with both of these scenarios a syntax error as simple as a missing comma can cause lost time trying to pin-point the issue. Meanwhile, Knime's node based eco-system removes that possible cause for error. Additionally, Knime's drag and drop interface allows users to build out data pipelines in mere seconds - you spend more time thinking about your data build than you do coding. |
